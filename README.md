# Course Overview
This is the first course in a five course *data science in educational research* specialization. All courses will be taught through [R](https://cran.r-project.org), a free and open-source statistical computing environment. This course, in particular, will introduce students to R and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com), version control with [git](https://git-scm.com) and [GitHub](https://github.com), dynamic and reproducible workflows with [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com), and basic data wrangling and visualization with the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org) suite of packages. 

# Student Learning Objectives
By the end of this course, students should be able to:

* Understand the R package ecosystem (how to find them, install, load, and learn what they do)
* Read "flat" (i.e., rectangular) datasets into R 
* Perform basic data wrangling and transformations in R, using the tidyverse
	+ Leverage appropriate functions for introductory data science tasks (pipeline)
	+ "clean up" the dataset using scripts and reproducible workflows
* Use version control with R via Git through RStudio Projects
* Use R Markdown to create reproducible dynamic reports
* Understand and create different types of data visualizations

# COURSE POLICIES
## Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
It is the policy of the University of Oregon to support and value equity and diversity and to provide inclusive learning environments for all students.  To do so requires that we: 

* respect the dignity and essential worth of all individuals. 
* promote a culture of respect throughout the University community. 
* respect the privacy, property, and freedom of others. 
* reject bigotry, discrimination, violence, or intimidation of any kind. 
* practice personal and academic integrity and expect it from others. 
* promote the diversity of opinions, ideas and backgrounds which is the lifeblood of the university.

In this course, class discussions, projects/activities and assignments will challenge students to think critically about and be sensitive to the influence, and intersections, of race, ethnicity, nationality, documentation status, language, religion, gender, socioeconomic background, physical and cognitive ability, sexual orientation, and other cultural identities and experiences. Students will be encouraged to develop or expand their respect and understanding of such differences.

Maintaining an inclusive classroom environment where all students feel able to talk about their cultural identities and experiences, ideas, beliefs, and values will not only be my responsibility, but the responsibility of each class member as well. Behavior that disregards or diminishes another student will not be permitted for any reason. This means that no racist, ableist, transphobic, xenophobic, chauvinistic or otherwise derogatory comments will be allowed. It also means that students must pay attention and listen respectfully to each other’s comments.

## Documented Disability
Appropriate accommodations will be provided for students with documented disabilities. If you have a documented disability and require accommodation, arrange to meet with the course instructor within the first two weeks of the term. The documentation of your disability must come in writing from the Accessible Education Center in the Office of Academic Advising and Student Services.  Disabilities may include (but are not limited to) neurological impairment, orthopedic impairment, traumatic brain injury, visual impairment, chronic medical conditions, emotional/psychological disabilities, hearing impairment, and learning disabilities. For more information on Accessible Education Center, please see http://aec.uoregon.edu 

## Mandatory Reporting of Child Abuse
UO employees, including faculty, staff, and GEs, are mandatory reporters of child abuse. This statement is to advise you that that your disclosure of information about child abuse to a UO employee may trigger the UO employee’s duty to report that information to the designated authorities. Please refer to the following links for detailed information about mandatory reporting:
http://hr.uoregon.edu/policies-leaves/general-information/mandatory-reporting-child-abuse-and-neglect

## Reporting Title IX Experiences
Any student who has experienced sexual assault, relationship violence, sex or gender-based bullying, stalking, and/or sexual harassment may seek resources and help at safe.uoregon.edu. To get help by phone, a student can also call either the UO’s 24-hour hotline at 541-346-7244 [SAFE], or the non-confidential Title IX Coordinator at 541-346-8136. From the SAFE website, students may also connect to Callisto, a confidential, third-party reporting site that is not a part of the university. 

Students experiencing any other form of prohibited discrimination or harassment can find information at aaeo.uoregon.edu or contact the non-confidential AAEO office at 541-346-3123 or the Dean of Students Office at 541-346-3216 for help. As UO policy has different reporting requirements based on the nature of the reported harassment or discrimination, additional information about reporting requirements for discrimination or harassment unrelated to sexual assault, relationship violence, sex or gender based bullying, stalking, and/or sexual harassment is available at http://aaeo.uoregon.edu/content/discrimination-harassment 

Specific details about confidentiality of information and reporting obligations of employees can be found at https://titleix.uoregon.edu. 

## Academic Misconduct Policy
All students are subject to the regulations stipulated in the UO Student Conduct Code http://conduct.uoregon.edu). This code represents a compilation of important regulations, policies, and procedures pertaining to student life. It is intended to inform students of their rights and responsibilities during their association with this institution, and to provide general guidance for enforcing those regulations and policies essential to the educational and research missions of the University.  

## Conflict Resolution 
Several options, both informal and formal, are available to resolve conflicts for students who believe they have been subjected to or have witnessed bias, unfairness, or other improper treatment. 

It is important to exhaust the administrative remedies available to you including discussing the conflict with the specific individual, contacting the Department Head, or within the College of Education, you can contact the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs and Equity (Krista Chronister, 346-2415, kmg@uoregon.edu). Outside the College, you can contact: 
* UO Bias Response Team: 346-3216 http://bias.uoregon.edu/whatbrt.htm 
* Affirmative Action and Equal Opportunity: 346-3123 http://aaeo.uoregon.edu/

## Grievance Policy
A student or group of students of the College of Education may appeal decisions or actions pertaining to admissions, programs, evaluation of performance and program retention and completion. Students who decide to file a grievance should follow the student grievance procedure, or alternative ways to file a grievance outlined in the Student Grievance Policy (https://education.uoregon.edu/academics/student-grievance) or enter search: student grievance.

## In Case of Inclement Weather 
In the event the University operates on a curtailed schedule or closes, UO media relations will notify the Eugene-Springfield area radio and television stations as quickly as possible. In addition, a notice regarding the university’s schedule will be posted on the UO main home page (in the “News” section) at http://www.uoregon.edu. Additional information is available at http://hr.uoregon.edu/policy/weather.html.

If an individual class must be canceled due to inclement weather, illness, or other reason, a notice will be posted on Canvas or via email. During periods of inclement weather, please check Canvas and your email rather than contact department personnel. Due to unsafe travel conditions, departmental staff may be limited and unable to handle the volume of calls from you and others.

## Course Incomplete Policy
Students are expected to be familiar with university policy regarding grades of “incomplete” and the time line for completion. For details on the policy and procedures regarding incompletes, Please see: https://education.uoregon.edu/academics/incompletes-courses
