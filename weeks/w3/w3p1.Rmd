# First: Cool stuff share!
* Equations within RMD look beautiful, but can be a pain
  + Must use \LaTeX (see examples [here](http://www.statpower.net/Content/310/R%20Stuff/SampleMarkdown.html))

# {dplyr} 
### A grammar for data wrangling

Take a guess - what do you think the following do? Discuss with your neighbor.

.pull-left[
* `select()`
* `filter()`
* `mutate()`
* `arrange()`
* `summarize()`
* `group_by()`
]

<img src = ../img/dplyr_hex.png width = 300 height = 300>
</div>

# {dplyr}
### A grammar for data wrangling

* `select()`: A subset of columns
* `filter()`: A subset of rows
* `mutate()`: Add or modify existing columns
* `arrange()`: Rows in a ascending or descending order
* `summarize()`: A variable according to other functions 
  + e.g., `mean()`, `sd()` 
  + Often used in conjunction with `group_by()`

# {janitor}: Cleaning up common dirt
Little easier (minus maybe the first one). Guess what these do?

.pull-left[
* `clean_names()` 
* `remove_empty_rows()` 
* `remove_empty_cols()`
]

<img src = ../img/janitor_hex.png width = 300 height = 300>
</div>

---
# {janitor}: Cleaning up common dirt

Little easier (minus maybe the first one). Guess what these do?
* `clean_names()`: Styles column names with snake_case
* `remove_empty_rows()`: Removes empty rows
* `remove_empty_cols()`: Removes empty columns
* `excel_numeric_to_date()`: Changes numeric dates imported from Excel to actual dates

# Arguments
* *dplyr* always takes a data frame as the first argument. 
* Subsequent argument tell *dplyr* what to do with the data frame.
* Returns the modified data frame

# Examples (follow along!)
We'll start with the presidential dataset from the *mdsr* package.

```{r pres_data_echo, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("mdsr")
library(mdsr)
presidential
```

```{r pres_data_eval, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(mdsr)
head(presidential)
```

---
# Select president name and party

```{r select_pres_party}
select(presidential, name, party)
```

---
# Use negation

```{r rem_start}
select(presidential, -start)
```

---
# Use indexing

```{r indexing}
select(presidential, 1:3)
```

# `filter()` boolean logic

.footnote[(Figure from Wickham & Grolemund, 2017)]


---
# filter for democrats

```{r dems}
filter(presidential, party == "Democratic")
```

Note the use of `==` not `=`

---
# Dems starting after 2000

```{r dems2000}
filter(presidential, 
       party == "Democratic" & 
       start > as.Date("2000-01-01"))
```

---
# Chaining arguments
* What if we wanted to select and filter a dataset?
* Select name and party of presidents who began their term after 2000

Two step method

```{r two_step}
after_2000 <- filter(presidential, start > as.Date("2000-01-01"))
select(after_2000, name, party)
```

---
# Chaining arguments
* Alternatively, we could wrap `select` around `filter`

```{r wrapped}
select(filter(presidential, start > as.Date("2000-01-01")), name, party)
```

---
# Chaining arguments
* Or, we could use another function to help increase the readability of our code: `%>%`
* Called the "pipe" operator and "piping functions"

```{r piping1}
filter(presidential, start > as.Date("2000-01-01")) %>% 
  select(name, party)
```

---
# Chaining arguments
Generally when using the pipe, the first argument is the dataset, which gets piped through the corresponding functions. So the code on the prior slide would more typically be written 

```{r piping2}
presidential %>% 
  filter(start > as.Date("2000-01-01")) %>% 
  select(name, party)
```

Note the indentation and line breaks to help keep things straight.


---
# Create a new variable

Let's go to a different dataset
(we'll talk about this more next class)

```{r load-reads}
library(rio)
library(here)
library(janitor)

reads <- import(here("data", "Project_Reads_Scores.csv"),
                setclass = "tbl_df") %>% 
  clean_names()
head(reads)
```

---
* Select the student id, test site, pre- and post-test scores

```{r prepost}
prepost <- reads %>% 
    select(student_id, test_site, pre_test_score, post_test_score)

prepost
```

---
# Add a variable

```{r mutate1, message = FALSE}
library(magrittr)
prepost %<>% 
  mutate(gain = post_test_score - pre_test_score)
 
prepost
```

---
# Quick note on  `%<>%` 
### The following are equivalent

```{r mutate2}
prepost %<>% 
  mutate(gain = post_test_score - pre_test_score)
```

```{r mutate3}
prepost <- prepost %>%  
  mutate(gain = post_test_score - pre_test_score)
```


---
# Order by gain: Least to greatest

```{r arrange}
prepost %>% 
  arrange(gain)
```

---
# Order by gain: greatest to least

```{r arrange_desc}
prepost %>% 
  arrange(desc(gain))
```

---
# `summarize`
* Compute the mean and standard deviation of the gain

```{r summarize}
prepost %>% 
  summarize(mean_gain = mean(gain),
            sd_gain = sd(gain))
```

---
# `group_by`

* Conduct an operation *by* each level of a grouping factor

Compute average wins for each team

```{r av_wins}
prepost %>% 
  group_by(test_site) %>% 
  summarize(mean_gain = mean(gain))
```
