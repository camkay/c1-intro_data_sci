# Agenda 
* Questions
* Workflows (quickly)
* Importing data
* A little more dplyr
* Lab


---
# Reading in data

* We'll use the [{here}](https://github.com/r-lib/here) package
  + Allows you to not worry about paths so much
  + Helps reproducibility

--
* In your R Studio project directory
  + Create a new folder called "data"
  + Place the data for today there

---
# Look at what data files are there

```{r here}
library(here)
list.files(here("data"))
```

---
# {rio}
* Super nice package - most of the time, it just works, regardless of the source file type.
* (If this isn't astounding to you, you obviously haven't struggled for hours to read in data properly)

Example: these all work! Try it out and verify for yourself!
```{r import_various, message = FALSE}
library(rio)
exam1 <- import(here("data", "exam1.csv"))
eclsk <- import(here("data", "ecls-k_samp.sav"))
fatality <- import(here("data", "Fatality.txt"))
```

---
# Read directly from the web!

```{r web_import}
pubschls <- import("https://github.com/datalorax/ncme_18/raw/master/data/pubschls.csv")
head(pubschls)
```

---
# Export just as easily!

```{r export, eval = FALSE}
export(exam1, here("data", "exam1.sav"))
export(exam1, here("data", "exam1.txt"))
export(exam1, here("data", "exam1.dta"))
```

---
# `convert()`  

* Another really useful feature is `convert()`, which just takes a file of one type and converts it to another.

--

* Say your advisor uses SPSS, but her/his colleague uses Stata. They might use some proprietary (and expensive) software like SAS/CONNECT. Instead, just run this one line of code and voila!

```{r convert, eval = FALSE}
convert(here("data", "ecls-k_samp.sav"), 
        here("data", "ecls-k_samp.dta"))
```

---
# How is this all working?

<div align = "center">
<img src = ../img/rio_support.png height = 500>
</div>


---
# Looking at the import documentation

```{r import_documentation, eval = FALSE}
?import
```
<div align = "center">
<img src = ../img/rio_doc.png height = 400>
</div>

---
# Maintaining labels
* In SPSS, numeric data are often encoded with labels
* rio (and {haven}) allow you to transform the data into the character/factor
verion

```{r eclsk-numeric, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
eclsk %>%
	select(child_id:ethnic) %>%
	head()
```

---
```{r eclsk-character}
eclsk %>%
	characterize() %>%
	select(child_id:ethnic) %>%
	head()
```

---
* Run the following line of code - what do you get?
* Note the `setclass` argument

```{r read-data}
library(rio)
reads <- import(here("data", "Project_Reads_Scores.csv"),
            setclass = "tbl_df") #<<
```


---
# Project Reads data

```{r proj_reads_data}
head(reads)
```

---
# Clean the names

```{r clean-reads}
library(magrittr)
reads  %<>% #<<
	janitor::clean_names()

head(reads)
```

---
# Dataset summary

```{r install-skimr, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("skimr")
```

```{r load-skimr, message = FALSE}
library(skimr)
```

[demo]

---
# Check out the structure

```{r reads-struc}
dim(reads)
str(reads)
```

---
# Oddity

```{r count-sid}
reads %>%
 count(student_id) 
```

---
# filter

Let's remove the summary rows at the end

```{r filter}
reads %<>% 
	filter(student_id != "All Students (Average)")

reads %>%
 count(student_id) 
```

---
# `select()` helper funs
* `starts_with()`
* `ends_with()`
* `contains()`


---
# `starts_with`

Let's use the Project Reads data

```{r starts_with}
reads %>% 
	select(starts_with("test"))
```

---
# `ends_with`

```{r ends_with}
reads %>% 
	select(ends_with("score"))
```

---
# `contains`

```{r contains}
reads %>% 
	select(contains("test"))
```

---
# Mix types

You can mix types and helper funs. You can also use select to rearrange your columns.

```{r mixed_types_select}
reads %>% 
	select(student_id, 1, starts_with("total"))
```

---
# Summarizing and plotting

* Calculate means by test site

```{r means-by-site}
reads %>%
	group_by(test_site) %>%
	summarize(mean = mean(post_test_score))
```

---
# Plot it
```{r means-plotted, fig.height = 5}
theme_set(theme_minimal(base_size = 25))

reads %>%
	group_by(test_site) %>%
	summarize(mean = mean(post_test_score)) %>%
	ggplot(aes(test_site, mean)) +
		geom_col(alpha = 0.8)
```

---
# Multi-group

Let's look at *ecslsk*

```{r ecls-cleanup}
eclsk %<>%
	characterize() %>%
	janitor::clean_names() %>%
	tbl_df()

head(eclsk)
```

---
# Summarize

```{r ecls-summarized}
ecls_smry <- eclsk %>%
	group_by(sex, ethnic) %>%
	summarize(t1r_mean = mean(t1rscale))
ecls_smry	
```

---
# Look for gender effects

```{r gender-effect1}
ggplot(ecls_smry, aes(ethnic, t1r_mean)) +
	geom_col(aes(fill = sex))
```

---
# Look for gender effects

```{r gender-effect2}
ggplot(ecls_smry, aes(ethnic, t1r_mean)) +
	geom_col(aes(fill = sex),
	         position = "dodge") #<<
```

---
# Rotating labels
Doesn't show up well on the slide but the relevant bit of code is

```{r, eval = FALSE}
theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))
```
I have to look this up just about every time (SO answer [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1330989/rotating-and-spacing-axis-labels-in-ggplot2))


---
# An alternative

```{r gender-effect3}
ggplot(ecls_smry, aes(sex, t1r_mean)) +
	geom_col(alpha = 0.8) +
	facet_wrap(~ethnic)
```

---
Occasionally doubling up works well, I think


```{r gender-effect4}
ggplot(ecls_smry, aes(sex, t1r_mean, fill = sex)) +
	geom_col(alpha = 0.8) +
	facet_wrap(~ethnic)
```

---
# Final notes on {dplyr}
* We'll be using it all term long
* Verbs can help you gain fluency
* There are also conditional and all-inclusive versions of `mutate`, `select`, and `summarize`.
  + For example `mutate_if(is.character, as.numeric)`, `select_if(is.numeric)`, etc.
