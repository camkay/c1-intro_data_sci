## Daily shares
* I will try to start each class by asking people to share out. 
  + What successes have you had? What spectacular failures? 
  + **Totally** voluntary

--

1. Read "flat" (i.e., rectangular) datasets into R 

--

1. Perform basic data wrangling and transformations in R, using the tidyverse
  + Leverage appropriate functions for introductory data science tasks (pipeline)
  + "clean up" the dataset using scripts and reproducible workflows

--

1. Use version control with R via git and GitHub

--

1. Use R Markdown to create reproducible dynamic reports, including APA manuscripts

--

1. Understand and create different types of data visualizations

---
# Weekly learning objectives

Provide you a frame for what you should be working to learn for that specific week.

--

### This week's objectives
* Understand the requirements of the course
* Understand the requirements of the final project
* Understand what distinguishes R from other data and statistical platforms
* Understand the basics of the R ecosystem
	+ What's a package? How do you get one? How do you use it?


---
# Coming into today you should:
* Have R and RStudio installed 
* Have a GitHub account
* Be setup with DataCamp and working through the introduction to the tidyverse
* We'll talk soon about getting git installed

---
# What this class is and is not

--

### Three foci
* Data structuring and manipulations
* Reproducible workflows
* Data visualization 


--

### This class is not
* All encompassing 
  + First of the series
* A statistics course 
  + We'll use stats in examples, though

Style guide! Have good grammar when you code.

http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html

Some quick advice:
* Keep everything lower case, unless there's a clear resason not to
* Use style that helps you spot errors in your code more quickly
* Whatever you do, be consistent

---
# Class format
### Practice, Practice, Practice
General format will include:
* ~10 minutes discussing last class topics
* ~20 minutes of lecture on new topic
* ~50 minutes working through challenges

All challenges are due before the next class. What you do not complete in class must be completed on your own time.

This structure is intended to provide you with lots of practice, and lots of time with me to help you puzzle through your problems.

&gt; "The bad news is that whenever you learn a new skill you're going to suck.
It's going to be frustrating. The good news is that is typical and happens to
everyone and it is only temporary. You can't go from knowing nothing to
becoming an expert without going through a period of great frustration and
great suckiness."

# Orientation of this course
* This course is oriented around the *tidyverse*. 
    + Very conscious decision that I really believe is the correct one.
    + The *tidyverse* is an alternative to base R functions

.major-emph-green[Welcome to R]

---
# What is R?
* A programming language
* Tremendously powerful and flexible statistical software that happens to be free
* No point-and-click interface
* Incredible array of external "packages" available for specialized analyses, data visualizations, or to automate much of the data "munging" process

---
# Code-based interface

![rstudio](../img/rstudio.png)

---
# Moving to code/programming

--

.pull-left[
### Advantages
* Flexibility
  + Essentially anything is possible
* Transparency
  + Documented history of your analysis
* Efficiency
  + Many (most?) tasks can be automated
]

--

.pull-right[
### Disadvantages
* Steep learning curve
	+ Absolutely requires a significant time investment
	+ Equivalent to learning a new language
* You will lose patience with point-and-click interfaces
* Likely to become "one of the converted"
]

---
# The R Learning Curve

.gray[(as seen by me)]

![](w1p1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

---
# How to learn R?
* Three most important ingredients: time, time, and more time
* A sprinkling of dedication and determination help.
* Be patient and forgiving with yourself. It will feel slow at first. Most people have not trained themselves to think in this way.

# R as a big calculator


```r
3 + 2
```

```
## [1] 5
```


```r
(1/-(3/2)^2) / 2^-1/9
```

```
## [1] -0.09876543
```

---
# Object Assignment
 
.pull-left[

### Assignment

```r
a &lt;- 3
b &lt;- 2
a + b
```

```
## [1] 5
```

```r
a / (a + b)
```

```
## [1] 0.6
```

]

--

.pull-right[
### Re-assignment


```r
a &lt;- 3
a
```

```
## [1] 3
```

```r
a &lt;- 7
a
```

```
## [1] 7
```

]

---
# Object Assignment (continued)

.pull-left[
Objects can be of a variety of types.


```r
string &lt;- "Hello world!"
logical &lt;- TRUE
double &lt;- 3.2587021
Integer &lt;- 6L
```
]

.pull-right[
In this case, we can't exactly do arithmetic with all of these. 
  For example


```r
string + double
```

```
## Error in string + double: non-numeric argument to binary operator
```
But, these objects can be extremely useful in programming.
]

# Functions and getting help

.pull-left[
### R functions
* Anything that carries out an operation in R is a function, even `+`. 
* Functions (outside of primitive functions) are preceded by `()`
    + e.g., `sum()`, `lm()`
]

.pull-right[
### Getting help
* `?` can be helpful, but often too advanced early on
    + Helpful for understanding the formal arguments of a function
    + Scroll down to the examples first
* Google is your  best friend
* Other resources discussed previously
* Your classmates!
* Me!
]

# A few examples of why I ðŸ’— R

### Web stuff
* [xaringan](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan) - Used to produce these slides!
  + Shameless self-plug - [slidex](https://github.com/datalorax/slidex) will help you move from PowerPoint to xaringan!
* [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) - Used to build your own (beautiful!) website!
* [rvest](https://github.com/hadley/rvest) - Used to scrape web data

### Data vis stuff
* [ggplot2](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org) - Should be your default by the end of this class. Really powerful package.
* [plotly](https://plotly-book.cpsievert.me) - A good starting point for interactive data visualizations
* [altair](https://github.com/vegawidget/altair)
