# R Packages

---
# "Out of the box" functionality

.pull-left[
### Some packages are *pre-loaded* 
* e.g.
	+ {base}
	+ {graphics}
	+ {stats}
]

.pull-right[
### Others are *pre-installed*
* e.g.
	+ {boot}
	+ {MASS}
	+ {Matrix}
]

---
# Pre-loaded vs installed

Pre-loaded packages work on launch. For example, `plot` is part of the {graphics} package, which ships with R.

```{r first_plot, fig.width = 12, fig.height = 5}
plot(x = 1:10, y = 1:10)
```

---
# {base} package

All functions come from a package! What do you get from the following?

.gray[.small[Those are backticks, which are at the top-left of your keyboard]]

```{r base, eval = FALSE}
?`+`
```

--
* Side note - any idea why we have to surround this with backticks?

--
* See [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36220823/what-do-backticks-do-in-r) 

> A pair of backticks is a way to refer to names or combinations of symbols that are otherwise reserved or illegal


--

* Also relevant, backticks define code in markdown (which we'll learn more about later), so you may seem them in error messages to signify `'this bit is code'`

# Pre-installed packages
* Outside of the packages that are *pre-loaded*, there are a number that come *pre-installed*. e.g.,
  + {MASS}
  + {boot}
  + {cluster}
  + {lattice}

--

* Packages that are not pre-loaded require an explicit call to the `library` 

---
# Example with {MASS}
* Say we want to simulate data from a multivariate normal distribution

```{r first_lib}
# Set up simulation parameters
n_obs <- 1000
means <- c(100, 50) # `c` comes from base - used to create a vector
error_cv <- matrix(c(100, 44, # `matrix` comes from base
					     44, 49), byrow = TRUE, ncol = 2) # part of base
cov2cor(error_cv) # part of stats package
```

---
# Simulation, continued

```{r sim}
library(MASS) # load the pre-installed package
sim <- mvrnorm(n = n_obs, mu = means, Sigma = error_cv)
head(sim) # print!
```

---
```{r sim_cor_plot, fig.width = 12}
plot(sim)
```

---
```{r check_sim_cor}
cor(sim)
```

### Overall takeaway
There is a *ton* of functionality that comes with R right from your initial download. But, the functionality can be extended further by installing other packages.

---
# Other packages

### On CRAN 
.pull-left[
![](../img/pkg_growth.png)
]

.pull-right[
* Any of these can be installed with `install.packages("pkg_name")`. You will then have access to all the functionality of the package.
* Notice this plot only goes to **mid-2014**. As of this writing (09/20/17), there are [12,618](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/) packages available on CRAN! 
]

# Other packages
### On GitHub

<div align = "center">
<img src = ../img/esvis.png height = 400>
</div>
]

.pull-right[
<div align = "center">
<img src = ../img/github_pkgs.png height = 400>
</div>
]

---
# Installing from GitHub

First, install the *devtools* package from CRAN

```{r install_devtools, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
```

Next, load the *devtools* library to access the `install_github` function. For example, to install my *esvis* package

```{r install_r2Winsteps, eval = FALSE}
library(devtools)
install_github("datalorax/esvis")
```

---
You then have access to all the functionality of that package once you load it. Let's look at these data:

```{r load_data_esvis, echo = FALSE}
library(esvis)
library(ggplot2)
theme_set(theme_minimal())
knitr::kable(head(benchmarks), row.names = FALSE, format = "html")
```

---
# PP-Plot
```{r load_esvis, fig.width = 13, fig.height = 6.5}
library(esvis) 
pp_plot(benchmarks, reading ~ ell)
```

---
# Look at it by FRL eligibility
```{r byfrl, fig.width = 13, fig.height = 6.5}
pp_plot(benchmarks, reading ~ ell + frl)
```

---
# Binned quantile effect sizes
```{r esvis_ptile, fig.width = 13, fig.height = 7}
binned_plot(benchmarks, math ~ ethnicity, qtile_groups = 5)
```

---
# Probably overly complicated
```{r esvis_ptile2, fig.width = 13, fig.height = 7, warning = FALSE}
binned_plot(benchmarks, math ~ ethnicity + season + frl, qtile_groups = 5)
```

---
# ES Calculation

```{r esvis_calcs}
hedg_g(benchmarks, 
       math ~ ethnicity + frl, 
       ref_group = ~White + `Non-FRL`)
```

---
# Is this exciting!?! YES!!!
Why is this such a big deal? 
* With just a basic knowledge of R you have access to literally thousands of packages
	+ Expanding on a daily basis
	+ Provides access to cutting edge and specialized functionality for analysis, data visualization, and data munging
	+ Some of the most modern thinking on data analysis topics are often represented in these packages

# A few examples of amazing packages

---
### First: the data

https://cepa.stanford.edu/seda/overview

```{r load_seda, include = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(fs)

seda <- read_csv(dir_ls(here("weeks", "w1", "data"), regexp = "seda"))
seda <- seda %>% 
  mutate(grade = parse_number(grade),
         time  = grade - 3)

# select cohort
criteria <- data_frame(year = 2009:2013, grade = 3:7)
seda <- semi_join(seda, criteria) %>% 
  select(stateabb, leaname, grade, time, mean_link_ela, mean_link_math)
```

.gray[.small[(loaded from code not displayed)]]

```{r head_seda}
seda
```

---
# lme4
Let's fit a multilevel linear growth model for ELA

Question: How much does the progression from Grades 3-7 vary by state?

```{r lme4_demo, message = FALSE}
# install.packages("lme4")
library(lme4)

mlm <- lmer(mean_link_ela ~ 1 + time + 
				(1 + time|leaname) + 
				(1 + time|stateabb), 
			data = seda,
			REML = FALSE)
```

---
```{r smry_lme4_lin}
summary(mlm)
```

---
# Prettier output? Use a different package!

```{r pretty_lme4_output, eval = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# install.packages("sjPlot")
library(sjPlot)
sjt.lmer(mlm, p.kr = FALSE) # Note, second argument generally not necessary
```

---

`r sjPlot::sjt.lmer(mlm, p.kr = FALSE, no.output = TRUE)$knitr`


---
# Quickly plot differences between states

```{r lme4_state_diff, results = "hide", fig.height = 6, fig.width = 12}
library(lattice) # pre-installed package
re <- ranef(mlm, condVar = TRUE)
qqmath(re)$stateabb
```

---
# Compare to a curvilinear model

```{r lme4_curv}
mlm_c <- lmer(mean_link_ela ~ 1 + poly(time, 2, raw = TRUE) +
				(1 + time|leaname) + 
				(1 + time|stateabb), 
			data = seda,
			REML = FALSE)
```

---
For more abbreviated (and essential) output

```{r mlm_c_smry_echo, eval = FALSE}
library(arm)
display(mlm_c, detail = TRUE)
```

```{r mlm_c_smry_eval, echo = FALSE}
arm::display(mlm_c, detail = TRUE)
```

---
# Compare models

```{r compare_mods}
anova(mlm, mlm_c)
```

# Tools outside of R

---
# git and GitHub
### Why?

--

1. Open, transparent, and public science

--

1. Reproducibility

--

1. Collaborative tool

--
1. Version control .gray[.smaller[(usually listed as the first reason)]]

---
### How?

1. Create an account
1. Get a GUI and/or learn the command-line tools
  + I'm okay with either or both, as long as you (sort of) know what you're doing 
1. Develop a solid understanding of the underlying structure, so you know what you want to do, even if you don't know how
  + stage, commit, push, pull
